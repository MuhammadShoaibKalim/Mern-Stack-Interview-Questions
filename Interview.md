    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
      ```

34. **What is the purpose of `useEffect` in React?**
    - **Answer:** `useEffect` is used for side effects, such as fetching data or subscribing to events.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      useEffect(() => {
        fetch('/api/data').then(response => response.json()).then(data => setData(data));
      }, []);
      ```

35. **What are props in React?**
    - **Answer:** Props (properties) are inputs to a component that allow data to be passed down from parent to child.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      function Greeting(props) {
        return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
      }
      ```

36. **What is the difference between state and props?**
    - **Answer:** State is managed within a component, while props are passed from parent to child components.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      function Parent() {
        const [message, setMessage] = useState('Hello');
        return <Child message={message} />;
      }
      ```

    - **Answer:** A functional component is a JavaScript function that returns JSX. It can use hooks for state and lifecycle features.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      const MyComponent = () => <h1>Hello, Functional Component!</h1>;
      ```

38. **What is a class component?**
    - **Answer:** A class component is a JavaScript class that extends `React.Component` and includes a render method.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      class MyComponent extends React.Component {
        render() {
          return <h1>Hello, Class Component!</h1>;
        }
      }
      ```

39. **What is the context API in React?**
    - **Answer:** The context API allows you to share data across components without passing props explicitly through every level.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      const MyContext = React.createContext();
      const MyProvider = ({ children }) => (
        <MyContext.Provider value="Hello">{children}</MyContext.Provider>
      );
      ```

40. **What are controlled components in React?**
    - **Answer:** Controlled components are form elements whose value is controlled by React state.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState('');
      return <input value={inputValue} onChange={e => setInputValue(e.target.value)} />;
      ```

41. **What are uncontrolled components in React?**
    - **Answer:** Uncontrolled components store their value in the DOM rather than in React state.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      return <input defaultValue="Hello" />;
      ```

42. **What is React Router?**
    - **Answer:** React Router is a library for routing in React applications, allowing you to create single-page applications with multiple views.
    - **Example:**

      <Router>
        <Route path="/about" component={About} />
      </Router>
      ```

43. **What is the purpose of `key` in React lists?**
    - **Answer:** The `key` prop helps React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed in a list.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      const items = [1, 2, 3].map(item => <li key={item}>{item}</li>);
      ```

44. **What are hooks in React?**
    - **Answer:** Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
      ```

45. **What is `useRef` in React?**
    - **Answer:** `useRef` is a hook that returns a mutable ref object which persists for the full lifetime of the component.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      const inputRef = useRef();
      const focusInput = () => {
        inputRef.current.focus();
      };
      ```

46. **What is prop drilling?**
    - **Answer:** Prop drilling refers to passing props from a parent component down to deeply nested child components.
    - **Example:** If `ComponentA` passes props to `ComponentB`, which passes it to `ComponentC`, it’s prop drilling.

47. **What is memoization in React?**
    - **Answer:** Memoization is an optimization technique to prevent unnecessary re-renders of components.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      const MemoizedComponent = React.memo(MyComponent);
      ```

48. **What is a higher-order component (HOC)?**
    - **Answer:** A higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component with additional props or behavior.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      const withLoading = (WrappedComponent) => {
        return (props) => {
          if (props.isLoading) return <Loading />;
          return <WrappedComponent {...props} />;
        };
      };
      ```

49. **What is error boundary in React?**
    - **Answer:** An error boundary is a React component that catches JavaScript errors in its child components and displays a fallback UI.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
        constructor(props) {
          super(props);
          this.state = { hasError: false };
        }
        static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
          return { hasError: true };
        }
        render() {
          if (this.state.hasError) {
            return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>;
          }
          return this.props.children; 
        }
      }
      ```

50. **What are the lifecycle methods in React?**
    - **Answer:** Lifecycle methods are hooks in class components that allow you to run code at specific points in a component's life.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      componentDidMount() {
        // Code to run when the component is mounted
      }
      ```

## MongoDB (NoSQL Database) Questions:

1. **What is MongoDB, and how does it differ from SQL databases?**
   - MongoDB is a NoSQL, document-oriented database that stores data in JSON-like documents. Unlike SQL databases, which store data in tables with fixed schemas, MongoDB has a flexible schema and stores data in collections of documents.

2. **Explain the structure of a MongoDB document.**
   - A MongoDB document is a JSON-like structure consisting of key-value pairs. It is similar to a dictionary in programming languages and can have nested documents.

3. **What are the advantages of using MongoDB?**
   - MongoDB is schema-less, scalable, supports horizontal scaling, has rich querying capabilities, and stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format, making it easy to work with evolving data models.

4. **How do you create a MongoDB database and collection?**
   - A database and collection are automatically created when you first insert data using `db.collection.insertOne()` or `db.collection.insertMany()`. You can also explicitly create collections with `db.createCollection()`.

5. **What are indexes in MongoDB, and why are they important?**
   - Indexes improve the speed of query execution by allowing MongoDB to quickly locate data without scanning the entire collection. However, they consume extra space and slow down write operations.

6. **How do you perform CRUD operations in MongoDB?**
   - CRUD operations can be performed using the following commands:
     - **Create**: `db.collection.insertOne()`, `db.collection.insertMany()`
     - **Read**: `db.collection.find()`
     - **Update**: `db.collection.updateOne()`, `db.collection.updateMany()`
     - **Delete**: `db.collection.deleteOne()`, `db.collection.deleteMany()`

7. **Explain the difference between `find()` and `findOne()` in MongoDB.**
   - `find()` returns all documents that match a query, while `findOne()` returns the first document that matches the query.

8. **What is the aggregation framework in MongoDB?**
   - The aggregation framework allows for the processing of data and transforming it through a pipeline of stages (like `$match`, `$group`, `$sort`) to perform calculations, filtering, and projections.

9. **How do you handle relationships in MongoDB (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many)?**
   - Relationships can be handled by embedding (storing related documents inside a document) or referencing (storing IDs of related documents in a separate document). Embedding is often used for one-to-one or one-to-many, while referencing is used for many-to-many relationships.

10. **What are the different types of data models in MongoDB?**
    - MongoDB supports two types of data models:
      - **Embedded Data Model**: Related data is stored within a single document.
      - **Referenced Data Model**: Related data is stored in separate documents and linked through references.

11. **How do you perform pagination in MongoDB?**
    - Pagination is typically performed using the `limit()` and `skip()` methods. `limit()` defines the number of documents to retrieve, while `skip()` specifies the number of documents to skip.

12. **Explain the purpose of `ObjectId` in MongoDB.**
    - `ObjectId` is the default unique identifier for documents in MongoDB. It contains a timestamp, a machine ID, a process ID, and an incrementing counter to ensure uniqueness.

13. **How do you update a document in MongoDB without changing the existing fields?**
    - Use the `$set` operator with `updateOne()` or `updateMany()` to update only the specified fields without altering the rest of the document.

14. **What is the difference between `save()` and `insert()` in MongoDB?**
    - `save()` either inserts a new document or updates an existing one if the document already has an `_id`, while `insert()` only inserts new documents.

15. **Explain what sharding is in MongoDB.**
    - Sharding is a method for distributing data across multiple servers to support horizontal scaling in MongoDB. It splits data into smaller, more manageable parts called shards.

## Express.js (Backend Framework) Questions:

16. **What is Express.js?**
    - Express.js is a minimal, fast web application framework for Node.js, designed for building APIs and web applications. It simplifies handling HTTP requests, middleware, and routing.

17. **What is middleware in Express.js?**
    - Middleware functions are functions that execute in the request-response cycle in an Express app. They can modify the request or response, end the request-response cycle, or call the next middleware in the stack.

18. **How do you define a route in Express.js?**
    - A route is defined using `app.get()`, `app.post()`, `app.put()`, or `app.delete()` methods. For example, `app.get('/users', (req, res) => { /* handler */ })` defines a GET route for the `/users` endpoint.

19. **How do you handle errors in Express.js?**
    - Errors are handled by defining error-handling middleware using four arguments: `(err, req, res, next)`. This middleware catches errors and sends appropriate responses.

20. **What is the purpose of `next()` in Express.js?**
    - `next()` is used to pass control to the next middleware or route handler in the stack. Without calling `next()`, the request-response cycle will not proceed.

21. **Explain the difference between `app.use()` and `app.get()` in Express.js.**
    - `app.use()` is used for applying middleware to all routes or specific route patterns, while `app.get()` defines a route for handling GET requests.

22. **How do you serve static files in Express.js?**
    - Static files (like HTML, CSS, JavaScript) can be served using the `express.static()` middleware. For example: `app.use(express.static('public'))`.

23. **What is a RESTful API?**
    - A RESTful API follows the principles of REST (Representational State Transfer) and is designed around resources, using HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for CRUD operations.

24. **How do you handle form data in Express.js?**
    - You can handle form data in Express.js using the `body-parser` middleware, which parses incoming request bodies and makes them available under `req.body`.

25. **What is CORS, and how do you enable it in Express.js?**
    - CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security feature in browsers that restricts web pages from making requests to a different domain. It can be enabled in Express.js using the `cors` package: `app.use(cors())`.
