## General Questions

1. **What is the MERN stack?**
   - **Answer:** MERN is a combination of four technologies: MongoDB (database), Express.js (backend framework), React (frontend library), and Node.js (JavaScript runtime).
   - **Example:** A full-stack web application that allows users to post and comment on articles.

2. **Why use Node.js?**
   - **Answer:** Node.js allows you to run JavaScript on the server, making it easier to build scalable applications using a single language.
   - **Example:** A chat application where both the client and server use JavaScript.

3. **What is MongoDB?**
   - **Answer:** MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in JSON-like documents, making it flexible and easy to scale.
   - **Example:** Storing user profiles as documents in a `users` collection.

4. **What is Express.js?**
   - **Answer:** Express.js is a web application framework for Node.js, used to build APIs and handle routing.
   - **Example:** Creating RESTful endpoints for a blog application.

5. **What is React?**
   - **Answer:** React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications.
   - **Example:** Building a dynamic user profile page that updates without refreshing.

## MongoDB Questions

6. **What is a document in MongoDB?**
   - **Answer:** A document is a record in MongoDB, stored in JSON format.
   - **Example:** `{ "name": "John", "age": 30 }` is a document representing a user.

7. **What is a collection in MongoDB?**
   - **Answer:** A collection is a group of documents, similar to a table in relational databases.
   - **Example:** A `users` collection contains all user documents.

8. **How do you connect to MongoDB using Mongoose?**
   - **Answer:** Use the `mongoose.connect()` method with the MongoDB URI.
   - **Example:**
     ```javascript
     const mongoose = require('mongoose');
     mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/mydatabase', { useNewUrlParser: true });
     ```

9. **What are schemas in Mongoose?**
   - **Answer:** Schemas define the structure of documents in a collection, including fields and data types.
   - **Example:**
     ```javascript
     const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
       name: String,
       age: Number,
     });
     ```

10. **How do you perform a query in MongoDB?**
    - **Answer:** Use methods like `find()`, `findOne()`, or `updateOne()`.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      User.find({ age: { $gt: 18 } });
      ```

11. **What is indexing in MongoDB?**
    - **Answer:** Indexing improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a collection.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      db.users.createIndex({ name: 1 }); // Creates an index on the name field
      ```

12. **What are MongoDB aggregation pipelines?**
    - **Answer:** Aggregation pipelines process data records and return computed results, similar to SQL GROUP BY.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      db.orders.aggregate([
        { $group: { _id: "$customerId", total: { $sum: "$amount" } } }
      ]);
      ```

13. **What is the purpose of the ObjectId in MongoDB?**
    - **Answer:** ObjectId is a unique identifier for documents, generated by MongoDB.
    - **Example:** Every document has a unique `_id` field, like `ObjectId("507f1f77bcf86cd799439011")`.

14. **How do you handle relationships in MongoDB?**
    - **Answer:** Relationships can be handled using references or embedded documents.
    - **Example:** 
      - **Reference:** 
      ```javascript
      const postSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
        title: String,
        author: { type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId, ref: 'User' }
      });
      ```
      - **Embedded Document:**
      ```javascript
      const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
        name: String,
        posts: [{ title: String }]
      });
      ```

15. **What is the difference between `find` and `findOne` in MongoDB?**
    - **Answer:** `find` returns an array of documents, while `findOne` returns a single document.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      User.find({ age: 30 }); // Returns an array
      User.findOne({ age: 30 }); // Returns a single document or null
      ```

## Express.js Questions

16. **How do you create a server with Express?**
    - **Answer:** Use the `express()` function and `app.listen()` method.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      const express = require('express');
      const app = express();
      app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
      ```

17. **What are routes in Express?**
    - **Answer:** Routes are endpoints in your application that define how to respond to client requests.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      app.get('/api/users', (req, res) => {
        res.send('Get all users');
      });
      ```

18. **What is middleware in Express?**
    - **Answer:** Middleware are functions that execute during the request-response cycle, used for tasks like logging or authentication.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      app.use((req, res, next) => {
        console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url}`);
        next();
      });
      ```

19. **How do you handle errors in Express?**
    - **Answer:** Use error-handling middleware to catch and respond to errors.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
        res.status(500).send('Something went wrong');
      });
      ```

20. **What is the purpose of `app.use()`?**
    - **Answer:** `app.use()` is used to mount middleware functions at a specific path.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      app.use(express.json()); // for parsing application/json
      ```

21. **What are HTTP methods?**
    - **Answer:** HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) define the action to be performed on a resource.
    - **Example:** 
      - **GET:** Retrieve data
      - **POST:** Create new data
      - **PUT:** Update existing data
      - **DELETE:** Remove data

22. **How do you send JSON responses in Express?**
    - **Answer:** Use `res.json()` to send a JSON response.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      app.get('/api/data', (req, res) => {
        res.json({ message: 'Hello World!' });
      });
      ```

23. **How do you serve static files in Express?**
    - **Answer:** Use the `express.static` middleware to serve static files.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      app.use(express.static('public')); // Serves files from the 'public' directory
      ```

24. **What is body-parser?**
    - **Answer:** Body-parser is a middleware that parses incoming request bodies and makes them available under `req.body`.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
      app.use(bodyParser.json());
      ```

25. **What are query parameters in Express?**
    - **Answer:** Query parameters are key-value pairs added to the URL, used for filtering or searching.
    - **Example:** 
      - URL: `/api/users?age=30`
      - Accessing in Express: `req.query.age`

26. **What is the `req` and `res` object in Express?**
    - **Answer:** `req` (request) contains information about the HTTP request, while `res` (response) is used to send responses to the client.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      app.get('/api', (req, res) => {
        console.log(req.method); // Logs the HTTP method
        res.send('Response from server');
      });
      ```

27. **How do you redirect requests in Express?**
    - **Answer:** Use `res.redirect()` to redirect the client to another route.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      app.get('/old-route', (req, res) => {
        res.redirect('/new-route');
      });
      ```
