        <Route path="/about" component={About} />
      </Router>
      ```

43. **What is the purpose of `key` in React lists?**
    - **Answer:** The `key` prop helps React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed in a list.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      const items = [1, 2, 3].map(item => <li key={item}>{item}</li>);
      ```

44. **What are hooks in React?**
    - **Answer:** Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
      ```

45. **What is `useRef` in React?**
    - **Answer:** `useRef` is a hook that returns a mutable ref object which persists for the full lifetime of the component.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      const inputRef = useRef();
      const focusInput = () => {
        inputRef.current.focus();
      };
      ```

46. **What is prop drilling?**
    - **Answer:** Prop drilling refers to passing props from a parent component down to deeply nested child components.
    - **Example:** If `ComponentA` passes props to `ComponentB`, which passes it to `ComponentC`, it’s prop drilling.

47. **What is memoization in React?**
    - **Answer:** Memoization is an optimization technique to prevent unnecessary re-renders of components.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      const MemoizedComponent = React.memo(MyComponent);
      ```

48. **What is a higher-order component (HOC)?**
    - **Answer:** A higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component with additional props or behavior.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      const withLoading = (WrappedComponent) => {
        return (props) => {
          if (props.isLoading) return <Loading />;
          return <WrappedComponent {...props} />;
        };
      };
      ```

49. **What is error boundary in React?**
    - **Answer:** An error boundary is a React component that catches JavaScript errors in its child components and displays a fallback UI.

      class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
        constructor(props) {
          super(props);
          this.state = { hasError: false };
        }
        static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
          return { hasError: true };
        }
        render() {
          if (this.state.hasError) {
            return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>;
          }
          return this.props.children; 
        }
      }
      ```

50. **What are the lifecycle methods in React?**
    - **Answer:** Lifecycle methods are hooks in class components that allow you to run code at specific points in a component's life.
