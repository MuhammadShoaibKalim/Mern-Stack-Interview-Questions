     ```javascript
     const mongoose = require('mongoose');
     mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/mydatabase', { useNewUrlParser: true });
     ```

9. **What are schemas in Mongoose?**
   - **Answer:** Schemas define the structure of documents in a collection, including fields and data types.
   - **Example:**
     ```javascript
     const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
       name: String,
       age: Number,
     });
     ```

10. **How do you perform a query in MongoDB?**
    - **Answer:** Use methods like `find()`, `findOne()`, or `updateOne()`.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      User.find({ age: { $gt: 18 } });
      ```

11. **What is indexing in MongoDB?**
    - **Answer:** Indexing improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a collection.

      db.users.createIndex({ name: 1 }); // Creates an index on the name field
      ```

12. **What are MongoDB aggregation pipelines?**
    - **Answer:** Aggregation pipelines process data records and return computed results, similar to SQL GROUP BY.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      db.orders.aggregate([
        { $group: { _id: "$customerId", total: { $sum: "$amount" } } }
      ]);
      ```

13. **What is the purpose of the ObjectId in MongoDB?**
    - **Answer:** ObjectId is a unique identifier for documents, generated by MongoDB.
    - **Example:** Every document has a unique `_id` field, like `ObjectId("507f1f77bcf86cd799439011")`.

14. **How do you handle relationships in MongoDB?**
    - **Answer:** Relationships can be handled using references or embedded documents.

      ```javascript
      const element = <div className="greeting">Hello, World!</div>;
      ```

33. **How do you manage state in React?**
    - **Answer:** Use the `useState` hook to manage component state.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
      ```

34. **What is the purpose of `useEffect` in React?**
    - **Answer:** `useEffect` is used for side effects, such as fetching data or subscribing to events.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      useEffect(() => {
        fetch('/api/data').then(response => response.json()).then(data => setData(data));
      }, []);
      ```

35. **What are props in React?**
    - **Answer:** Props (properties) are inputs to a component that allow data to be passed down from parent to child.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      function Greeting(props) {
        return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
      }
      ```

36. **What is the difference between state and props?**
    - **Answer:** State is managed within a component, while props are passed from parent to child components.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      function Parent() {
        const [message, setMessage] = useState('Hello');
        return <Child message={message} />;
      }
      ```

37. **What is a functional component?**
    - **Answer:** A functional component is a JavaScript function that returns JSX. It can use hooks for state and lifecycle features.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      const MyComponent = () => <h1>Hello, Functional Component!</h1>;
      ```

38. **What is a class component?**
    - **Answer:** A class component is a JavaScript class that extends `React.Component` and includes a render method.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      class MyComponent extends React.Component {
        render() {
          return <h1>Hello, Class Component!</h1>;
        }
      }
      ```

39. **What is the context API in React?**
    - **Answer:** The context API allows you to share data across components without passing props explicitly through every level.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      const MyContext = React.createContext();
      const MyProvider = ({ children }) => (
        <MyContext.Provider value="Hello">{children}</MyContext.Provider>
      );
      ```

40. **What are controlled components in React?**
    - **Answer:** Controlled components are form elements whose value is controlled by React state.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState('');
      return <input value={inputValue} onChange={e => setInputValue(e.target.value)} />;
      ```

41. **What are uncontrolled components in React?**
    - **Answer:** Uncontrolled components store their value in the DOM rather than in React state.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      return <input defaultValue="Hello" />;
      ```

42. **What is React Router?**
    - **Answer:** React Router is a library for routing in React applications, allowing you to create single-page applications with multiple views.
    - **Example:**

      import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
      <Router>
        <Route path="/about" component={About} />
      </Router>
      ```

43. **What is the purpose of `key` in React lists?**
    - **Answer:** The `key` prop helps React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed in a list.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      const items = [1, 2, 3].map(item => <li key={item}>{item}</li>);
      ```

44. **What are hooks in React?**
    - **Answer:** Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
      ```

45. **What is `useRef` in React?**
    - **Answer:** `useRef` is a hook that returns a mutable ref object which persists for the full lifetime of the component.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      const inputRef = useRef();
      const focusInput = () => {
        inputRef.current.focus();
      };
      ```

46. **What is prop drilling?**
    - **Answer:** Prop drilling refers to passing props from a parent component down to deeply nested child components.
    - **Example:** If `ComponentA` passes props to `ComponentB`, which passes it to `ComponentC`, it’s prop drilling.

47. **What is memoization in React?**
    - **Answer:** Memoization is an optimization technique to prevent unnecessary re-renders of components.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      const MemoizedComponent = React.memo(MyComponent);
      ```

48. **What is a higher-order component (HOC)?**
    - **Answer:** A higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component with additional props or behavior.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      const withLoading = (WrappedComponent) => {
        return (props) => {
          if (props.isLoading) return <Loading />;
          return <WrappedComponent {...props} />;
        };
      };
      ```

49. **What is error boundary in React?**
    - **Answer:** An error boundary is a React component that catches JavaScript errors in its child components and displays a fallback UI.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
        constructor(props) {
          super(props);
          this.state = { hasError: false };
        }
        static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
          return { hasError: true };
        }
        render() {
          if (this.state.hasError) {
            return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>;
          }
          return this.props.children; 
        }
      }
      ```

50. **What are the lifecycle methods in React?**
    - **Answer:** Lifecycle methods are hooks in class components that allow you to run code at specific points in a component's life.
    - **Example:**
      ```javascript
      componentDidMount() {
        // Code to run when the component is mounted
      }
      ```
